The [HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUGO_Gene_Nomenclature_Committee) (HGNC) is a committee of the [Human Genome Organisation](https://www.hugo-international.org/) that sets standards for human genome nomenclature.
An **HGNC symbol** is a unique abbreviation assigned to human genes to ensure clear and consistent communication in scientific research.
